# Malware-Analysis
## Objective
The primary objective of malware analysis is to understand the behavior, functionality, and impact of malicious software (malware) on computer systems, networks, and users.

### Tools Used
- Wireshark : Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that serves various purposes in the field of networking, security, and troubleshooting. It allows users to capture, inspect, 
and analyze network traffic in real-time or from stored capture files e.g., .pcap files
- tshark : Dump and analyze network traffic. Without any options set, TShark will work much like tcpdump. It will use the pcap library to capture traffic from the first available network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for each received packet.
- HashTab: HashTab is a free tool that integrates directly into Windows Explorer. It adds a "File Hashes" tab to the file properties dialog, where you can see various hash values for the selected file.
